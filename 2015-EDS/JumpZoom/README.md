# Jump Zoom

Quartz Beta 2 demo showing how to chain together asynchronous navigation methods, waiting until one is complete before beginning a second navigation call. If first navigation is cancelled by the user interacting with the MapView, then the second navigation call is not made. Uses MapView navigation methods that return ListenableFuture.

Uses ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android Quartz release, Beta 2.

***Note: Quartz Beta 2 was released in March 2016. Check the [Esri Maven repository on Bintray](https://bintray.com/esri/arcgis/arcgis-android/view) for the latest release.***

## Features
* MapView.setViewpointWithDurationAsync
* ListenableFuture
* NavigationCompletedListener

## Requirements
* Android API level 16 (Android 4.1.x) or later, with internet access
* Android Studio

## Usage
Import into Android Studio by browsing to and choosing the root build.gradle file. Build the project and deploy the app to your device or emulator.

Tap the menu icon to open the navigation drawer, and choose different locations to zoom to. The map will zoom out to show the extent of both the previous and next location, before zooming in again. Tap the floating action button to zoom out to full extent.

You can use the default gestures on the map to zoom in or out and pan the map; this will cancel any current programmatic navigation.
