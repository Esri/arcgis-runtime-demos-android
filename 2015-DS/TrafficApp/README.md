Traffic App
=======================
This is an example of a Map-as-context app, where the map itself is auxillery information and is altered based on other information and tools in the app. For more information on this pattern see [this Guide doc](https://developers.arcgis.com/android/guide/determine-your-app-map-pattern.htm).
It shows current traffic incidents and conditions for Redlands. You can click on a specific incident to zoom to its location. You can use the calendar tool to change the date to see historical or predictive traffic conditions. You can also pan and zoom the map to see other areas.
